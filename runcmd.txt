1. The Immediate Fix (The Bridge)
Keep your Metro terminal running. Open a new, second PowerShell window and run this exact command:

PowerShell
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
If that returns an error like device not found, your USB cable is loose or "USB Debugging" turned itself off on your phone. Unplug the cable, plug it back in, and make sure you see the "Allow USB Debugging?" prompt on your phone screen.

2. The "Nuclear" Restart
If adb reverse doesn't fix it instantly, the ADB server itself has crashed. Run this sequence in your terminal:

PowerShell
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
3. Verification
Once you run those, go back to your phone and Shake the device to ope


If the app is already on your phone
If you've already built the app and just need to start the Metro bundler so the code updates when you save, use this "Cache-Buster" version:

PowerShell
npx expo start --dev-client -c
Pro-Tip for your notes:
If the app opens but can't connect to your computer, remember the "Handshake" command to link the ports:

PowerShell
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
